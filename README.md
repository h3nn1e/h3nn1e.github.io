What is money?
Money is an item that is used to pay for other goods, services, and other items. 

Knowing that we need money to buy things, we need money to have a proper life. Without money we wouldn't be able to go to good schools. We wouldn't be able to have a good house to shelter us. We wouldn't have any proper food. My point is, we wouldn't have an easy life.

Money is often the reason on why people steal, fight, die, and struggle. Money isn't easy to get too so some people use dangerous ways to achieve their money. How can we get money without having to use such unsafe ways? Why do we need money?

## Why do we need money?
1. Things we need to survive (e.g. Food and water)

2. Sanitary needs (e.g. Napkin, tissues, soap, toothbrush, toothpaste, and etc..)

3. Shelter (e.g. houses)

4. Needed appliances (e.g. Refrigerator, stove, oven, and etc..)

5. Likes and wants (e.g. Phones, laptops, cars, toys, and etc..)

There are a lot of things that we need and want but can only be taken if we have the money to buy them. Then how do we get money? We get money by working and in excahnge of working, people get payed. What are some of the high paying jobs some people like and study for?

## What are some of the common jobs most people get?
1. Cashier

2. Accountant

3. Teacher

4. Sales person

5. Janitor

6. Construction worker

7. Bookkeeper

8. Nurse

9. Marketing staff

10. Receptionist 


### If you are looking for a high paying job in the Philippines, maybe these are the type of jobs you should be studying for:
1. Doctor (Avarage salary: 166,000 PHP)

2. Lawyer (Avarage salary: 113,000 PHP)

3. Judge (Avarage salary: 139,000 PHP)

4. Psychiatrist

5. Orthodontist and many more

If we want to get a big salary we should study hard for the jobs that pay high, money is not easy to obtain and that is why we should study and work for it.





To me personally, money buys happiness. If only we were wealthy, my parents wouldn't have to be fighting or struggling about the bills and debts and we could live happily with everything we could ever want. I can't say the same for everyone but to me, money is the most important thing in the world. We should study and work hard to make this place a better place and to help ourselves too.

Time goes fast,

money doesn't last,

work your best,

don't forget rest.
